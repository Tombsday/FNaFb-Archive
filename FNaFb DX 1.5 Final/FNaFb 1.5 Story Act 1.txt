After the Events of Five Nights at Fuckboy's Deluxe...

Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy are discussing about the profits their game made.
2,000,000 tokens. They're rich!

Meanwhile...

B.B. got fucked up. His masterplan? Ruined. He's found in somesort of factory. (Aftermath Factory)
B.B.'s head is almost cut into two from the damage. There's only one thing B.B. wants, and that's revenge.
He explores the factory, finding out that there's a whole bunch of machines(obviously). He wants to use these
machines to power his own factory, where he can lead Freddy & Co. into the factory, and destroy them once and for all.

There isn't enough power though. He needs to concoct some sort of way to get power... The 80's. He goes back to the 80's,
before the events of the Five Nights at Fuckboy's 2 Deluxe. The B.B. in this timeline just is a down to earth guy. He wants
to make a profit off of his tinkering of objects. 90's B.B. Befriends him, asking him to help him. They both start fucking up
endoskeletons, tinkering them for production.

Act 1 ends with the two B.B.s fucking up every single endoskeleton, and not really making good friends with the rest of the
animatronics. 80's B.B. gets frustrated by this, and 90's B.B. explains his plan. His plan to destroy them all.
Flashforward to the end of FNaFb 2, where 90's B.B., playing as 80's B.B., fucks up again. Before the bite in this timeline,
He sends the Toys and Withered Animatronics to the 90's, where they fight 90's Freddy & Friends. The Both of them realize
that they have a common enemy in the enragement child. 90's Freddy intercepts the mail, and It's an advertisement
for a nearby factory. They decide to go there, and check what's going on.
